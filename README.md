<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Hotel staffs are usually very good with memory. They remember what their regular guests' preferences and try to make the stay experience as smooth and enjoyable as possible. However, what if you just started to work in a new hotel? What if it's the first time meeting a regular guest and you don't know their preference?

myGuests app will be the solution to hoteliers as it will keep record of your guests and you are able to check your guests preference with a few taps.

Current MVP version only shows you the basic information of your guests, but below backlogs are being worked on;
- Able to see your guests preference when tapping on their names
- Able to see your guests according to their reservation status (in-house guests, departing guests, arriving guests)
- Able to make modification to the data
